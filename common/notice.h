/* notice.h - the announcement modals (docs/AUDIO.md section 4a, 2026-09-15):
 * a milestone the moment it is earned, a stage reached, low battery.
 *
 * Milestones are set in several places (progression.c, tank.c), so the
 * queue does not need hooks: notice_tick diffs each fish's ms_bits, the
 * tank's tank_ms_bits and each fish's stage against what it announced
 * last frame. notice_sync adopts the current state silently (boot, a
 * restored save, a reset) so nothing old is announced. A fish that
 * appears (an arrival) is adopted silently too - the birth flow is its
 * announcement - but the population milestone it brings is queued.
 *
 * One notice is up at a time for NOTICE_UP_S, or until a tap; the next
 * waits NOTICE_GAP_S. Nothing shows while `blocked` (setup / birth flow /
 * reset prompt up, or a fry's welcome due - setup_birth_due):
 * the queue holds, and a notice already up steps aside and comes back after
 * (without its cue again). 2026-09-29, Strato: "the milestone achievement
 * notification and the new fry welcome message overlap. the milestone should
 * wait until the 'meet it' sequence is done" - the fry is born mid-frame and
 * its population badge came up the frame before the flow opened.
 * Each notice carries the cue to play when it comes up; the platform takes
 * it with notice_take_cue.
 *
 * NOTICE_LIGHTS_OUT (2026-10-03, Strato: "in case it surprises someone the
 * first time it happens"): the first double-tap that turns the light off
 * (tank.h light_tip_seen, saved) says so, once, without a chime. A tap on it
 * closes it AND reaches the tank (notice_dismiss returns false), so the
 * double-tap it asks for works with the notice still up. */
