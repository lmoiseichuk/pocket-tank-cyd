/* update_mode.h - update mode on the tank (docs/OTA.md, 2026-09-30).
 *
 * The settings page's CHECK FOR UPDATES does not start the radio: the tank
 * saves, main.c calls update_mode_request, and the board restarts. At the
 * top of app_main, once the display, the glass and the PMIC are up and
 * before anything else exists, update_mode_pending says whether this boot
 * was asked for; update_mode_run then owns the board - the pages in
 * common/update.c over net_port_esp.c - until the keeper is done. It
 * returns when the outcome is "back to the tank" (the radio is already
 * off) and never returns on an install (it restarts into the new slot).
 *
 * The request rides in RTC memory (RTC_NOINIT, the batlog's pattern: a
 * magic word and its complement), so it survives the software restart and
 * nothing else - a power-off clears it, and it can never get stuck. */
