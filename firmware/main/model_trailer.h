/* model_trailer.h - the model partition's validity marker (docs/OTA.md,
 * "Model updates", 2026-09-30).
 *
 * A 7.5 MB model cannot be double-buffered in 16 MB, so an over-the-air
 * model write is in place. The LAST sector of the model partition (the body
 * stays at offset 0, nothing moves) holds this trailer: written LAST by a
 * model write, erased FIRST, so a half-written model is never mistaken for
 * a good one. The cable installer writes it as a 4 KB part
 * (tools/make_installer.py, model_trailer.bin). A tank that has a model
 * but no trailer (a cable install that skipped it, QEMU) hashes the body
 * once at boot: the hash the build shipped with (PT_MODEL_SHA256) matches ->
 * the trailer is written; anything else runs as it is (a keeper's own model)
 * and says so in the log. Phase two (the model download) adds the "dirty"
 * flag: a write that began and never finished. */
